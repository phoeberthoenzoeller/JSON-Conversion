program converts JSON formatted text files into more readable HTML.
&nbsp;It is tailored specifically to those JSON files produced by a
formerly popular knitting site. &nbsp;The program will however operate
on all properly formatted JSON files. 
A file named json.css is created along with the HTML files.  This .css file must be in the same folder with the html files for the html files to be presented as intended.
<br><h3>File Selection:</h3>The file selection interface allows the user to:<br>1) Select a single JSON file.<br>2) Select multiple JSON files.<br>3) Select a folder name that holds JSON files.<br>If
a file is selected then those selected files may have any suffix.
&nbsp;It is up to the user to ensure that they are valid JSON files
from the knitting site. &nbsp;If a folder is selected then the program
will convert all files found in that folder with a suffix of .json.
  All HTML output files will be written to the same folder as the source JSON files.
  NOTE: A folder with a large number of files can take a very long time to process.  My wife's favorites files, numbering in excess of 1400 files, required over an hour to process.
.<br><h3>Preferences:</h3>By
default all HTML produced is black type on a white background.
&nbsp;You may prefer to display categories of text in a different
manner. &nbsp;The content of the output is unchanged. &nbsp;Only the
presentation is effected.<br><h3>Disclaimer:</h3>This program was\n
thrown together in one evening. &nbsp;It has not had the luxury of the
usual software life cycle advantages such as project management, unit
testing, beta testing, limited release and review. &nbsp;Nope, I banged
out some code and hoped for the best. &nbsp;And so, if this program
does not perform as intended please let me know and I'll have another
go at it.</div></div></body></html>"
